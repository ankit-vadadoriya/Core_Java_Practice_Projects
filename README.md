# 2. EmployeePayrollSystem

## Project Description

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based application designed to streamline payroll management by leveraging core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Built with concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, this project demonstrates the application of Java OOP to solve real-world payroll processing challenges efficiently.

## Features

- **Employee Management** : Create, update, and manage employee information.
- **Payroll Calculation** : Automatically calculates salary based on hours worked, overtime, bonuses, and other customizable payroll parameters.
- **Report Generation** : Generates detailed reports on employee payments, deductions, and earnings summaries.

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation** : Securely stores employee and payroll data, only allowing controlled access through getter and setter methods.
- **Inheritance** : Extends classes for different employee types, allowing specific functionality per role.
- **Polymorphism** : Applies method overloading and overriding to handle varied payroll scenarios.
- **Abstraction** : Provides an interface for payroll operations, allowing flexible implementations.
